# Travellist - Laravel Demo App with Docker

This is a Laravel 6 demo application to support our Laravel guides.

This repository is just to exercise my docker skills.
I follow [this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-set-up-laravel-with-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04-pt) for this repo.
See ya.
